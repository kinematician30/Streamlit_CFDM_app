## _Credit Card Fraud Detection_
This project was built as machine learning project [Type: Classification]. The original dataset 
is the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset on kaggle 
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud), there 
were no missing values and less preprocessing was done.

The model was deployed using Streamlit an opensource framework for data science and machine 
learning webapps.
